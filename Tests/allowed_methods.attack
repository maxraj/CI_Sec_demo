Feature: Look for unallowed HTTP methods using arachni against the application

Background:
  Given "arachni" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
     | name      | environment_variable_name   |
     | hostname  | TARGET_HOSTNAME             |
     
Scenario: Do a check for unallowed methods and verify no issues are found on the login page
  When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
  """
  arachni --checks=allowed_methods --scope-directory-depth-limit=1 http://<hostname>:8008/login
  """
  Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected."
